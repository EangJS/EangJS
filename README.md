- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EangJS
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more on computing especially software engineering having a taste on 
      both backend and frontend work (as well as finding lazy ways :) via automation)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying computer engineering in NUS (Currently in my Second Year). During my free time build personal projects using python with google api, very basic android apps (flutter/java))
